# Proyecto-Modelado-Predictivo-Magic

This repository contains the code for the analysis and modeling of the magic04 dataset.

## Model Variants

There are two main model variants for the magic04 dataset. The first one uses linear models and the second one uses Support Vector Classifier (SVC) models:

1. `linear-models`: This variant is dedicated to the usage of linear models for the analysis and modeling of the magic04 dataset.
2. `svc-models`: This variant focuses on the usage of Support Vector Classifier (SVC) models for the analysis and modeling of the magic04 dataset.

## To_Test

The `To_Test` directory contains the necessary files to duplicate the models using the pickle files. It includes the following files:

- `MAGIC04_1V5.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook contains the code to test the logistic regression models using the pickle files.
- `svc.py`: This Python script contains the code to test the SVC models using the pickle files.

## Pickles

The `pickles` directory contains the pickle files that can be used to reproduce the examples.

## Optimizacion_hiperparameters

The `Optimizacion_hiperparameters` directory contains the code to optimize the hyperparameters of the SVC models.

## MAGIC04.data

The `MAGIC04.data` directory contains the dataset and the names of the columns.

## MAGIC04.ipynb

The `MAGIC04.ipynb` Jupyter notebook contains the analysis and modeling code for the magic04 dataset.

Please refer to the respective directories and files for more details and instructions.
